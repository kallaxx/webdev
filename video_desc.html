        <h2>The video's description</h2>
        <p>There is a young man talking to the camera through the whole video talking while there is funky music playing
            in the background. He’s saying:
            <br />
            “So maybe you're hanging out with your friends, and suddenly people start talking about the 16
            personalities. Myers-Briggs, MBTI. They start saying weird stuff like, "I'm an INFJ." "I'm an ENTP." And
            you're like, "What?" Are we supposed to just all act like everybody knows what this gobbledygook means? What
            do the letters mean? The four letters, when people are talking about these personality types, I'm gonna
            explain it to you like you're five. Okay, maybe not like you're five, but maybe like a smart ten-year-old.
            The four letters that make up a personality type are just preferences, that's all, no big deal. It's how you
            observe the world, and how you make decisions. Each Myers-Briggs personality type has four letters in it,
            each of those letters has two options, that's two times two times two times two. That's 16, boom. Honors
            Pre-calculus in 11th grade, yo.
            <br />
            The first letter is I or E. That stands for Introvert or Extravert, easy enough, right? Well, don't get too
            comfortable, 'cause that's the easiest one.
            <br />
            The next letter is S or N, which stands for Sensing or Intuition. I know, intuition starts with an I, but
            the symbol is N, it's confusing but just roll with it. Sensing and intuition are the ways that we make
            observations of the world around us. Sensing is pretty easy; how do we observe the world with our five
            senses? What are the facts? What are the numbers? Intuition is about what are the patterns at work here?
            What are the higher-level concepts? Everybody uses both sensing and intuition. You couldn't make yourself a
            ham sandwich for lunch without both. Could you? Ah... maybe. [laughing] But you do have a preference at
            least 51% of the time of one over the other.
            <br />
            The third letter in the type is F or T, which stands for Feeling and Thinking, which are the two ways that
            we make decisions. Feeling is not so much emotion, but value. What value do I give something? Is it good or
            bad? Do I like it or not like it? Making a decision based on feeling is like I'm gonna do this because I
            like it, or because other people like it. Thinking, on the other hand, is logical, rational. Does it make
            sense? Does it work? Is it true? Making a decision with thinking is: "I'm gonna do this because it just
            makes sense, it just works. "We all do both every day, and the personality type isn't meant to put you in a
            box. It's just meant to say a majority of the time what do you prefer?
            <br />
            The fourth letter is J or P. Do you prefer John or Paul as your favorite Beatle? Ha, ha, ha... just kidding.
            No, J verses P is really Judging verses Perceiving. And to be honest with you, this letter is like the least
            precise in its meaning but let me try to give you a little bit of what it's going for. So, the P and J stand
            for perceiving and judging. Perceiving meaning observations, judging meaning decisions. So, when you have a
            P type, generally when they're making decisions, they're looking at themselves first and foremost. What do I
            think is the right decision here? I'm gonna go with that. P types also, when they're making observations,
            wanna gather as many as possible. They don't wanna limit it, and they don't really wanna organize it either.
            The J types, on the other hand, when they're making decisions, they wanna look around, and get a good
            cross-section of what everyone else thinks is the right decision to make here, and then they'll make it
            based off of that. When making observations, the J types don't wanna take in a crap ton of observations,
            like the P types, they wanna limit it, and just chew on a few choice observations for a while, organize them
            over and over. And this is why the J types, generally to the outside world, can look a bit more organized,
            and the P types can look like crazy, disorganized, their life is a mess. But they're having fun.
